# Hej! I’m Frida.  
### 👩‍💻 Software Developer. 🎨 Textile Artist. 📍 Stockholm.

I build things for the web with a mix of logic and aesthetics. With a background in fine arts (MFA, Konstfack) and a growing joy for web development - I used to build in fiber; now I build in code. I have a sharp eye for design and strive to write clean, DRY and clever code. Always eager to learn more and with software development, it's neverending.

I started coding in 2023 through completing the Technigo Web Development Boot Camp. I quickly realized that coding sparks the same curiosity and investigative mindset as working with previous physical projects did. Problem-solving, structure, and ideation feeds into each other. I'm currently studying Frontend Development at Medieinstitutet in Stockholm, graduating in 2026.
