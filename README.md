# Hej! I’m Frida.  
### 👩‍💻 Software Developer. 🎨 Textile Artist. 📍 Stockholm.

I build things for the web with a mix of logic and creativity. With a background in fine arts (MFA, Konstfack) and a growing joy for software development - I used to build in fiber; now I build in code. I have a sharp eye for design and strive to write clean, DRY and clever code. Always eager to learn more and with development, it's neverending.

I started coding in 2023 through completing the Technigo Web Development Boot Camp. I quickly realized that coding sparks the same curiosity and investigative mindset as working with previous physical projects did. Problem-solving, structure, and ideation feeds into each other. I'm currently studying Frontend Development at Medieinstitutet in Stockholm, graduating in 2026. While my main focus is frontend, my education also dives into backend development — a field I’ve found a deep interest in. I really enjoy the logic of the server-side and understanding how the whole system connects. I like architecting the flow of data, ensuring it is parsed and transformed efficiently. 

I'm currently working on my degree project: **Depeche Music**, a full-stack application where my love for music and development come together.
