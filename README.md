## Hej! I’m Frida.

### **👩‍💻 Frontend developer. 🎨 Textile artist. 📍 Stockholm-based.** 

I build things for the web with a mix of logic and aesthetics. With a background in fine arts (MFA, Konstfack) and a newfound joy in web development, I used to build in fiber; now I build in code. Same creative brain, different tools. I have a sharp eye for design and a deep appreciation for clean, functional code—because, at its core, code is just another medium.

### What I Bring
- **🛠️ Tech & Tools**: JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, Vue.js, React, Pinia, Redux, Node.js, Git, Vite, Postman, Figma.
- **🤝 Ways of Working**: Accessibility (a11y), Agile, Pair Programming.   
- **🎭 Creative Edge**: Years of experience in visual arts and design, now applied to pixels instead of fibers.  

### My Journey So Far
I started coding in 2023 and quickly realized that writing code scratches the same itch as working with my physical art projects. It has similar creative outlets and challenges - problem-solving, structure, and creativity aren’t separate skills - they feed into each other. Currently studying Frontend Development at Medieinstitutet in Stockholm, graduating in 2026.
